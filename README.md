# A description on your's truly!
Hello, my name is Chase. I have recent knowledge on C, and old knowledge on Python, JavaScript, and HTML.

I am currently majored in Computer Engineering.

I am currently trying to brush up on my programming skills, and would like to eventually create a small game to concrete my programming knowledge into actual experience.

I enjoy learning new things, and have always loved science and experimenting.

I also enjoy messing with circuitry. And engineering in general. Building and programming stuff is cool.
I once made an 8 bit adder just because. I just thought that was a cool project...
