# A description on your's truly!
Hello, my name is Chase. I have recent knowledge on C, and old knowledge on Python, JavaScript, and HTML.

I am currently majored in Computer Engineering, though I will likely change majors.

I am currently trying to brush up on my programming skills, and would like to eventually create a small game to concrete my programming knowledge into actual experience.

I also enjoy messing with circuitry. And engineering in general.
I once made an 8 bit adder just because. I just thought that was a cool project...
